This is a primitive server library that includes HTTPServer and SocketServer

HttpServer -> rusty_stormy::HttpServer
SocketServer -> rusty_stormy::SocketServer

More documentation coming soon (I need to fully flesh out the design and test it for performance. In the mean time, read Server.rs and types.rs in each server's directory for some understanding)
